# AidaDSP

AidaDSP is a shield for Arduino2 and TivaC boards.
Basically, you have a small but powerful DSP from Analog Devices
capable of 24bit-48/96/192kHz audio processing on the fly. 
Thanks to our library (AidaDSP's official library on Github https://github.com/AidaDSP) you can
integrate the control of this DSP in the Arduino enviroment.
You can do things like remote EQ (just use our library and your favourite bluetooth module, and you're done)
or more complex, with algorithms spanning from pro audio multiband compressors to beam forming techniques.
Audio ethusiasts, this board is for you!!!
