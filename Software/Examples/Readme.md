List of Sigma Studio design files
to use with sketches given with AIDA DSP board

- Tutorial_1	dsp internal volume control via external pot
- Tutorial_2	master volume control with ext. microcontroller (from this example the parameters are written/readed by microcontroller)
- Tutorial_3	1st order equalizer 
- Tutorial_4	4-band parametric equalizer (2nd order)
- Tutorial_5	stereo rms compressor with post gain
- Tutorial_6	stereo peak compressor with post gain
- Tutorial_7	multiple signal generator (synthesizer) with rms/peak volume readback
- Tutorial_8	distortion!!! both hard and soft clipping blocks multiplexed

- Motown 		a 7 band parametric equalizer with fixed musical frequencies
- TS9 			the replica of the evergreen stomp box for guitar
